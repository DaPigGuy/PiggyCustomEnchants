## FAQ
**Q:** How do I create/use an enchanted book? </br>
**A:** If you want to create an enchanted book, use the /ce enchant command on a normal book. Afterwards, you place the item you want to enchant on top of the enchanted book. It will then enchant your item.

## Prerequisites
* Basic knowledge on how to install plugins from Poggit Releases and/or Poggit CI
* PMMP 4.0.0
* MCPE protocol 471 (v1.17.40)

## Installation & Setup
1. Install the plugin from Poggit.
2. (Optional) Configure your PiggyCE
   * Enchantment rarities, max levels, names, descriptions, & chances can be configured in their respective JSON files.
        * `chances.json`: Allows custom chance multipliers for any reactive enchantments.
            * Reaction chances are calculated by `chance multiplier * enchantment level`.
            * The chance multiplier by default is 100 for most enchantments.
   * Extra enchantment settings can be found under `extra_data.json`
   * The `config.yml` has many options. Some that you should pay attention to are:
     * `disabled-enchants`: Allows certain enchants to be disabled
     
         ```yaml
            disabled-enchants:
              - Porkified
         ```
     * `per-world-disabled-enchants`: Allows certain enchants to be disabled in specific worlds
     
         ```yaml
            per-world-disabled-enchants:
              # Disables Porkified & Volley in PlotWorld
              PlotWorld:
                - Porkified
                - Volley
              # Disables Jetpack in SurvivalWorld
              SurvivalWorld:
                - Jetpack
         ```
     * `world-damage`: Toggles world damage for explosive enchantments
